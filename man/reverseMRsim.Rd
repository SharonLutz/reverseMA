\description{
A function to similate the performance of different MR methods from the MendelianRandomization package in scenarios of reverse causality.
}
\usage{
reverseMRsim(n = 1000, nSNP = 3, MAF = c(0.2, 0.2, 0.2), gamma0 = 0, gammaX = c(0.2, 0.2, 0.2), varM = 1, beta0 = 0, 
betaM = c(0, 0.1), varY = 1, nSim = 100, plot.pdf = T, plot.name = "reverseMRsim.pdf", alpha_level = 0.05, SEED = 1)
}

\value{
a matrix of the power of three Mendelian Randomization approaches from the MendelianRandomization package to detect an effect of the mediator M on the outcome Y when M and Y are correctly specified and also when they are incorrectly specified (the true mediator is Y and the true outcome is M)
