## reverseC
This package examines the performance of Mendelian Randomization (MR) and Mediation Analysis methods in the presence of reverse causality. 

## reverseC for Mendelian Randomization
A full a description of the R functions that examine the role of the exposure on the outcome when the outcome is correctly and incorrectly specified for 3 common MR approaches is given [here](READMEmr.md).

## reverseC for Mediation Analysis
A full a description of the R functions that examine the role of the exposure on the outcome through the mediator when the outcome is correctly and incorrectly specified for mediation analysis is given [here](READMEma.md).
